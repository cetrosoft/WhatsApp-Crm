---

### Dynamic Menu System ⭐ NEW
**Status:** ✅ Complete (100%)
**Completion Date:** October 11, 2025

#### Problem Solved
- **Original Issue:** Menu items were hardcoded in `menuConfig.jsx`, causing "Pipelines" to show in English instead of Arabic
- **Solution:** Implemented complete database-driven menu system with two-layer filtering

#### Architecture
- **Database-driven:** All menu items stored in `menu_items` table
- **Bilingual support:** Separate columns for `name_en` and `name_ar`
- **Two-layer filtering:**
  1. **Package features** - Organizations see modules based on subscription tier
  2. **User permissions** - Users see items based on role permissions
- **Hierarchical structure:** Parent-child relationships for nested menus
- **Icon mapping:** Integration with Lucide React icons
- **Multi-tenant standardized:** No per-organization customization

#### Features Delivered
- [x] `menu_items` table with bilingual columns
- [x] `get_user_menu(user_id, lang)` PostgreSQL function
- [x] Backend API routes (GET, CRUD operations)
- [x] Frontend `useMenu` hook for data fetching
- [x] Updated Sidebar component to consume dynamic menu
- [x] Real-time language switching (EN ↔ AR)
- [x] Automatic permission filtering
- [x] Package-based feature access control
- [x] Fallback to hardcoded menu on error
- [x] Nested menu support (unlimited depth)

#### Database Schema
```sql
menu_items
├── id (UUID, PK)
├── key (VARCHAR, UNIQUE)
├── parent_key (VARCHAR, FK to menu_items.key)
├── name_en (VARCHAR)
├── name_ar (VARCHAR)
├── icon (VARCHAR)
├── path (VARCHAR)
├── display_order (INTEGER)
├── required_permission (VARCHAR)
├── required_feature (VARCHAR)
├── is_active (BOOLEAN)
└── is_system (BOOLEAN)
```

#### API Endpoints: 5
- GET /api/menu?lang={en|ar} - Get filtered menu for current user
- GET /api/menu/all - Admin: Get all menu items
- POST /api/menu - Admin: Create menu item
- PATCH /api/menu/:key - Admin: Update menu item
- DELETE /api/menu/:key - Admin: Delete menu item

#### Files Created/Modified
- **Database:** `supabase/migrations/015_dynamic_menu_system.sql`
- **Backend:** `backend/routes/menuRoutes.js`
- **Frontend Hook:** `Frontend/src/hooks/useMenu.js`
- **Sidebar Update:** `Frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`
- **API Client:** Updated `Frontend/src/services/api.js` with `menuAPI`

#### Testing Results
- ✅ Arabic menu translation working: "خطوط المبيعات" (Pipelines)
- ✅ Language switching real-time update
- ✅ Permission filtering functional
- ✅ Package feature filtering ready
- ✅ Nested menus rendering correctly
- ✅ Fallback to hardcoded menu working

#### Technical Challenges Solved
1. **SQL Column Ambiguity:** Used `ALIAS FOR` to avoid parameter/column conflicts
2. **Supabase RPC Naming:** Maintained original parameter names for RPC compatibility
3. **Two Sidebar Files:** Identified correct file (`layout/Sidebar.jsx`)
4. **Import Error:** Fixed named import for `authenticateToken` middleware
5. **File Location:** Ensured migration in correct directory

#### Business Value
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new modules without code changes
- **Localization:** Menu items translate automatically
- **Multi-tenant:** Standardized menus across all organizations
- **Package Control:** Menu visibility tied to subscription tier
- **Security:** Permission-based access control at menu level
