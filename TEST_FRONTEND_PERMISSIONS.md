# Frontend Permission System - Testing Guide

## Before You Start

**Important:** The "User Permissions" tab only shows users who have custom permission overrides. If all users are using default role permissions, the tab will be empty (this is correct behavior).

## Step-by-Step Testing

### Step 1: Open Browser DevTools
1. Open Chrome/Edge/Firefox
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Clear console (click üö´ icon)

### Step 2: Navigate to Roles & Permissions Page
1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/team/roles`
2. Look at console output - you should see:
   ```
   === ROLES & PERMISSIONS DEBUG ===
   Total users loaded: X
   Users with custom permissions: 0 (or more)
   User data sample: [...]
   ```

### Step 3: Check User Data Structure
In the console, expand "User data sample" and verify:
- Each user has an `email` field ‚úì
- Each user has a `role` field ‚úì
- Each user has a `permissions` field ‚úì
- `permissions` is either:
  - `{}` (empty object) - User has NO custom permissions
  - `{grant: [...], revoke: [...]}` - User HAS custom permissions

### Step 4: Test Granting Permissions
1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/team/members`
2. Find any user (not yourself)
3. Click the **Shield icon** (üõ°Ô∏è) next to their name
4. A modal should open showing "Manage Permissions"
5. In the modal:
   - See their current role
   - See permission groups (CRM, Settings, Team, Organization)
   - Check a permission box (e.g., "Create Tags" under Settings)
   - Click **Save Changes**

6. Watch the console - you should see:
   ```
   === SAVING PERMISSIONS ===
   User: user@example.com
   Granting: ["tags.create"]
   Revoking: []
   Permission update result: {...}
   Users refreshed after permission update
   ```

### Step 5: Verify Permission Saved
1. Go back to: `http://localhost:5173/team/roles`
2. Click on **User Permissions** tab
3. The user you just modified should now appear!
4. You should see:
   - User's name and email
   - Their role
   - Green badge showing "Granted (1)" with "Create Tags" listed

### Step 6: Verify in Console
Look at console again:
```
=== ROLES & PERMISSIONS DEBUG ===
Total users loaded: 4
Users with custom permissions: 1  ‚Üê Should be 1 now!
User data sample: [
  {
    email: "user@example.com",
    role: "agent",
    permissions: {
      grant: ["tags.create"],
      revoke: []
    }
  }
]
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "User Permissions" Tab is Empty
**Cause:** No users have custom permissions yet (all using role defaults)

**Solution:** This is CORRECT behavior! Follow Step 4 above to grant permissions.

**How to verify it's working:**
- Console shows: `Users with custom permissions: 0`
- You see the helpful message with instructions
- No errors in console

### Issue 2: Console Shows Errors
**Possible errors:**
- `Failed to load team members` - Backend not running or auth issue
- `Failed to get user permissions` - Permission API endpoint issue
- `Network error` - Backend not accessible

**Solutions:**
1. Verify backend is running: `http://localhost:5000/api/users`
2. Check you're logged in (auth token exists)
3. Verify you have admin/manager role (only they can manage permissions)

### Issue 3: Permission Modal Doesn't Open
**Cause:** JavaScript error or missing component

**Solution:**
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify you're on `/team/members` page
3. Verify you clicked the Shield icon (not the dropdown)

### Issue 4: Permissions Not Saving
**Cause:** API error or permission issue

**Solution:**
1. Check console for error message
2. Verify you're not trying to modify your own permissions (blocked)
3. Verify you have `permissions.manage` permission

## Manual API Testing

### Get All Users (should include permissions field)
```bash
# Get your auth token from: DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí authToken

curl http://localhost:5000/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "role": "agent",
      "permissions": {},  ‚Üê Should be present
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### Grant Permission to User
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/users/USER_ID/permissions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"grant": ["tags.create"], "revoke": []}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Permissions updated successfully",
  "user": {
    "permissions": {
      "grant": ["tags.create"],
      "revoke": []
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

### Get User's Effective Permissions
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/users/USER_ID/permissions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "userId": "...",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "agent",
  "rolePermissions": ["contacts.view", ...],
  "customPermissions": {
    "grant": ["tags.create"],
    "revoke": []
  },
  "effectivePermissions": ["contacts.view", ..., "tags.create"],
  "effectivePermissionsCount": 13
}
```

## Expected Console Output (Full Flow)

### Initial Load (No Custom Permissions)
```
=== ROLES & PERMISSIONS DEBUG ===
Total users loaded: 4
Users with custom permissions: 0
User data sample: [
  { email: "admin@test.com", role: "admin", permissions: {} },
  { email: "agent@test.com", role: "agent", permissions: {} }
]
```

### After Granting Permission
```
=== SAVING PERMISSIONS ===
User: agent@test.com
Granting: ["tags.create"]
Revoking: []
Permission update result: {message: "Permissions updated successfully", ...}
Users refreshed after permission update
```

### Reload Roles Page
```
=== ROLES & PERMISSIONS DEBUG ===
Total users loaded: 4
Users with custom permissions: 1  ‚Üê Changed!
User data sample: [
  { email: "admin@test.com", role: "admin", permissions: {} },
  {
    email: "agent@test.com",
    role: "agent",
    permissions: {
      grant: ["tags.create"],
      revoke: []
    }
  }
]
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Console shows debug output without errors
‚úÖ Backend returns `permissions` field for all users
‚úÖ "User Permissions" tab shows empty state with instructions
‚úÖ Clicking Shield icon opens permission modal
‚úÖ Granting permission saves successfully
‚úÖ User appears in "User Permissions" tab after grant
‚úÖ Green/red badges show granted/revoked permissions
‚úÖ Can open modal again and see changes reflected

## What to Report if Still Broken

1. **Full console output** (copy/paste)
2. **Network tab** showing API requests/responses
3. **Screenshot** of the User Permissions tab
4. **Backend response** when calling `/api/users` manually
5. **Your user role** (admin/manager/agent/member)
