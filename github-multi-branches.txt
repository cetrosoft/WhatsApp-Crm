Great question! Let me explain git branching clearly:

  What is "feature/crm-complete"?

  Your current situation:
  - You have a branch called crm (your main development branch)
  - feature/crm-complete is a NEW branch that will be created FROM the crm branch
  - It's like making a copy of crm to work on separately

  Branch naming convention:
  - feature/ is just a prefix to organize branches by type
  - feature/crm-complete means: "A feature branch for completing CRM modules"
  - Other examples:
    - feature/admin-portal = feature for admin portal
    - bugfix/deal-cards = bug fix for deal cards
    - hotfix/login-error = urgent fix for login

  How Git Branches Work (Same Folder!)

  Important: Git does NOT create separate folders for branches!

  D:\omnichannel-crm-saas  ← You only have ONE folder
  ├── backend/
  ├── Frontend/
  ├── docs/
  └── ...

  When you switch branches, Git CHANGES the files in THIS folder

  Visual Example:

  # Step 1: You're on "crm" branch
  git checkout crm
  # Files in D:\omnichannel-crm-saas now show "crm" branch content

  # Step 2: Create new branch "feature/crm-complete" from "crm"
  git checkout -b feature/crm-complete
  # Still in D:\omnichannel-crm-saas
  # Files are IDENTICAL to "crm" branch (it's a copy at this moment)

  # Step 3: Make changes (add Activities module)
  # Edit files in D:\omnichannel-crm-saas

  # Step 4: Commit changes
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add activities module"
  # Changes are saved to "feature/crm-complete" branch

  # Step 5: Push to GitHub
  git push -u origin feature/crm-complete
  # Sends "feature/crm-complete" branch to GitHub
  # Your "crm" branch on GitHub is UNCHANGED

  Why Create Separate Branches?

  Instead of working directly on "crm" branch:

  | Working on "crm" directly                 | Using feature branches                 |
  |-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
  | ❌ If you break something, "crm" is broken | ✅ "crm" stays safe                     |
  | ❌ Can't work on 2 features at once        | ✅ Work on admin + CRM at same time     |
  | ❌ Hard to undo changes                    | ✅ Easy to delete branch and start over |
  | ❌ Can't test separately                   | ✅ Test each feature independently      |

  How Parallel Work Works (2 Sessions):

  Session 1 Window:
  # In VS Code Window 1
  git checkout feature/admin-portal
  # Files in D:\omnichannel-crm-saas now show admin-portal branch
  # You work on admin portal
  # Changes only affect THIS branch

  Session 2 Window:
  # In VS Code Window 2 (SAME folder, different window!)
  git checkout feature/crm-complete
  # Files in D:\omnichannel-crm-saas now show crm-complete branch
  # You work on CRM modules
  # Changes only affect THIS branch

  Magic: Both windows point to D:\omnichannel-crm-saas, but show DIFFERENT files because they're on DIFFERENT branches!

  How Push Works:

  # When you're on "feature/crm-complete" branch
  git push -u origin feature/crm-complete

  # This sends:
  # FROM: Your local "feature/crm-complete" branch
  # TO: GitHub "feature/crm-complete" branch
  # Location: https://github.com/cetrosoft/omnichannel-crm-ticket/tree/feature/crm-complete

  # Your "crm" branch is NOT affected!

  Recommended Workflow:

  # 1. Start from "crm" branch (your base)
  git checkout crm
  git pull origin crm  # Get latest changes

  # 2. Create feature branch for CRM completion
  git checkout -b feature/crm-complete
  # Now you're on NEW branch (copy of "crm")

  # 3. Work on CRM modules
  # Edit files, test, commit

  # 4. Push to GitHub
  git push -u origin feature/crm-complete
  # Creates new branch on GitHub

  # 5. When done, merge back to "crm"
  git checkout crm
  git merge feature/crm-complete
  git push origin crm
  # Now "crm" has your new features!

  # 6. Delete feature branch (optional)
  git branch -d feature/crm-complete

  Summary:

  - ✅ Same folder (D:\omnichannel-crm-saas)
  - ✅ Multiple branches (like different versions)
  - ✅ Switch branches = files change automatically
  - ✅ Work safely without breaking main code
  - ✅ Professional workflow used by all developers
