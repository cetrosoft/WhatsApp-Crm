## 🐛 **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

1. **Stage Colors:** Tailwind classes like `bg-${color}-100` don't work dynamically. Need to use full class names or inline styles.
   - **Fix in Progress:** Will update StageBuilder to use inline styles or predefined classes.

2. **Drag-and-Drop:** Uses basic HTML5 drag API, not @dnd-kit.
   - Works fine for simple reordering
   - No visual feedback during drag (can be improved)

---

## 🔜 **NEXT STEPS (Session 3)**

Now that Pipeline Management is complete, you can:

1. **Create Multiple Pipelines:**
   - Sales Pipeline (for sales team)
   - Support Pipeline (for customer success)
   - Custom Pipelines (for different processes)

2. **Go Back to Deals Page** (`/crm/deals`):
   - You'll now see multiple pipelines in the dropdown
   - Add deals to different stages
   - Drag deals between stages
   - See pipeline-specific stats

3. **Next Features to Build:**

## 💡 **USAGE TIPS**

1. **Default Pipeline:** Always have one default pipeline - this is used for new deals
2. **Stage Colors:** Use consistent colors across pipelines for visual clarity
3. **Stage Names:** Keep names short (1-2 words) for better Kanban display
4. **Minimum Stages:** Every pipeline must have at least 1 stage
5. **Reordering:** Stages are automatically reordered when you drag them - no manual sorting needed

---

**Congratulations!** You now have a fully functional pipeline management system! 🚀

Go ahead and create your pipelines, add more stages to your existing "Sales Pipeline", and see them reflected immediately on the Deals Kanban board!
